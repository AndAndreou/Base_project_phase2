This is the Pro-Version of our City Package.
This package contains a very high detailed city with 
more than 50 unique buildings.
Everythings is build and textured very realistic.
This scene is perfect for prototypings and presentations
of your own gameconcepts.
The pro version of this package requires UnityPro and
includes our "VISky" sky-system for lighting.
The total scene uses more than one million polygons and
more than 200 textures.
Texture sizes between 64x64 to 2048x2048.
All buildings are single objects and can be used otherwise
in your own scenes.
All Logos in the scene are fictional our logos of our company
and some of our partners and can be shown in commercial productions
or feel free to paint your own logos into the textures.

In the VISky Folder you will find all instruction for how to use
the Sky-System.
